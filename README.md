# Credit Card Approval Prediction
Capstone project for UC Berkeley AI/ML certification program

## Executive summary
TBD

### Research Question
How can we accurately predict whether a credit card application will be approved based on an applicant’s financial and personal information?

### Rationale
This question is crucial because it addresses the efficiency and accuracy of credit card approval processes. By developing a predictive model, financial institutions can make more informed decisions, reduce the risk of approving unsuitable candidates, and improve customer satisfaction by speeding up the approval process. The insights gained from this project will be translated into actionable business intelligence, providing clear, data-driven recommendations that non-AI/ML personnel can implement to enhance their credit card approval strategies.

This project aims to bridge the gap between complex machine learning models and practical business applications, ensuring that the results are both understandable and actionable for stakeholders.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis focuses on understanding the dataset’s structure, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and discovering patterns and correlations among features. This includes visualizations and statistical summaries to ensure the data is clean and ready for modeling.
1. Understand the Dataset

	* Load the Data: Import the dataset and inspect the first few rows to get an overview.
	* Data Types: Check the data types of each column to understand what kind of data you are dealing with (e.g., numerical, categorical).

2. Data Cleaning

	* Missing Values: Identify missing values and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).
	* Outliers: Detect outliers that might skew the analysis and decide on appropriate handling methods.
	* Duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate records.

3. Data Analysis
    * Correlation Matrix: Compute and visualize the correlation matrix to see relationships between numerical features.
	* Scatter Plots: Create scatter plots for pairs of numerical features to visually inspect relationships.
	* Cross-tabulation: For categorical features, create cross-tabulations to understand their interactions.

4. Feature Engineering

	* Feature Creation: Based on initial findings, create new features that might enhance model performance.
	* Transformation: Apply necessary transformations (e.g., log transformation) to normalize skewed data.
